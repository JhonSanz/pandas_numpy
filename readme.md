Here you are going to find some studies about pandas and numpy libraries.

I want to learn data manipulation because I want to involve into machine learning someday

__This repo is divided in two folders, numpy and pandas.__ I encourage you to take a look of these, there were used basic features of these libraries, but is a good way to start.

In each folder you will find a little summary of its content.
